# SIGMETRICS 2023

This repo holds information on our SIGMETRICS 2023 submission.

## TODOs

TODOs are tracked in Todoist.

## Reproducibility

[ACM Guidelines](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current)

We will aim to be both Repeatable and Reproducible. Whether or not the
results are Replicatable will be up to future researchers.

### Repeatble

*A researcher can reliably repeat her own computation.*

### Reproducible

*An independent group can obtain the same results using the author's artifacts.*

#### Proposed workflow

The following steps should be easily accomplished by the artifact evaluation committee:
1. Acquire datasets
2. Run experiments*
3. Validate experimental results
4. Plot data

\* Note on running experiments: The experiments will likely take a long time to run. We will need to decide which
of the following steps to take (possibly a combination of them):

1. Provide cluster time
2. Provide a reduced set of experiments to run (allow for larger error bars, run subset of apps, etc.)
3. Provide expected experimental output data

#### Documentation
We must provide high quality documentation for all tools associated with the project.

#### Availability

We need to provide a DOI or citation for all datasets.
