# SIGMETRICS 2023

This repo holds information on our SIGMETRICS 2023 submission.

## TODOs

TODOs are tracked in Todoist.

## Reproducibility

[ACM Guidelines](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current)

We will aim to be both Repeatable and Reproducible. Whether or not the
results are Replicatable will be up to future researchers.

### Repeatble

*A researcher can reliably repeat her own computation.*

### Reproducible

*An independent group can obtain the same results using the author's artifacts.*
